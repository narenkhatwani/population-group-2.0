# Population Group 2.0

### Abstract
The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus is
arguably the most comprehensive repository of biomedical terminologies. The
UMLS Semantic Network in orders of magnitude is smaller than the Metathesaurus
and contains 127 Semantic Types. One of those is “Population Group” – a Semantic
Type that encompasses concepts related to various demographics and social groups.
However, with the evolution of societal dynamics, the current classifications seem
to have become insufficient for distinctively capturing the semantics of the
contemporary societal structures. In this paper, we propose a re-evaluation and
expansion of the “Population Group” Semantic Type to better accommodate these
societal realities. With the introduction of the suggested new Semantic Types, we
aim to facilitate more precise healthcare data management, research, and policy
making.
